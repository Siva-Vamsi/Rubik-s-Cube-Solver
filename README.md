Rubik's Cube Solver - Brief Overview

 **Introduction**
The Rubik's Cube Solver simplifies solving the Rubik's Cube using **Richard Korf's Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) algorithm**, which is known for its efficiency in solving puzzles with large state spaces.


 **Key Features**
1. **IDA* Algorithm**: Guarantees optimal solutions with minimal moves.
2. **Interactive Interface**: Command-line input for easy cube configuration.
3. **Customizability**: Configurable parameters like depth limit and heuristics.
4. **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Understand the solution process visually.
5. **Optimal Solutions**: Always delivers the shortest solution path.





 **Algorithm Overview**
The solver employs **IDA***, combining **depth-first search** with heuristic evaluation for a memory-efficient search through vast state spaces, ensuring optimal solutions.
